**	INTRODUCTION**

This Report is based on feedback provided in preparation for, notes taken during, and additional material provided after the Government Data & Privacy Roundtable. The City Attorney of Oakland and Startup Policy Lab organized the Government Data & Privacy Roundtable [Roundtable] at Oakland’s City Hall on November 13, 2014. 

The substantive portion of the Roundtable had two parts. The first part of the Roundtable consisted of three presentations. The presentations touched upon the City of Oakland’s experiences in managing data and privacy, an introduction to the Open Data initiative by the [City of San Francisco from the Chief Data Officer](http://data.sfgov.org), and a review of lessons learned of policies –both successful and unsuccessful – being implemented around the nation by the [National Policy Manager of the Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com). The second part of the Roundtable consisted of an open conversation, from which the recommendations and issues discussed below were identified.
