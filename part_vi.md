For the purposes of this white paper, the term “Open Data “is capitalized as a point of identification.  See, e.g., Sunlight Foundation, Open Data Policy Comparison.

For example, the city of Oakland, California, releases information on where and when arrests were made, which is put out on a private website, Oakland Crimespotting. At one point a few clicks revealed that police swept the whole of a busy street for prostitution every evening except on Wednesdays, a tactic they probably meant to keep to themselves.” http://www.economist.com/node/15557443  See, e.g. Sunlight Foundation’s discussion of forward thinking Open Data policies versus traditional approaches. 2.

One approach would be a regional working group (e.g. Bay Area, Los Angeles, etc.); this would allow smaller focused efforts and some degrees of experimentation with different concepts and policies. This approach does, however, have the risk of balkanizing policies across the state. Another approach is statewide initiative led by the State of California, or with substantial participation from State subject matter experts, such as the Chief Information Officer of California. This approach would support consistency and standards across the state. Although such an approach might be more complicated to develop.  The California Government Operations Agency is responsible for administering state operations including procurement, information technology, and human resources.  The mission of CalGovOps is to improve management and accountability of government programs, increase efficiency, and promote better and more coordinated operation decisions. http://www.govops.ca.gov/Home.aspx  http://www.cio.ca.gov/Government/IT_Policy/  http://www.cacities.org/Resources/Charter-Cities  Sunlight Foundation, Open Data Policy Guidelines. “Most government information disclosure laws and systems currently in place, including right-to-know, freedom of information and public records laws, are vehicles for reactive disclosure.” http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/    Sunlight Foundation, Open Data Policy Guidelines. http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/    See, e.g., Office of the Attorney General of California, Summary of the California Public Records Act 2004. http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/publications/summary_public_records_act.pdf  For further discussion on the desire for granular data collected and held by government entity.

The CDO and the Chief Innovation Officer play fundamentally different roles serving widely different purposes, with different metrics of success.  There is no required path for a city to take; for example, some cities have used Executive Orders to create the position of CDO, as opposed to enacting legislation.   For a discussion on issues of the onward transfer principle in the context of the EU-Safe Harbor Compliance.
