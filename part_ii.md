# **II.	REPORT SUMMARY**

Open Data practices[1] – making government owned data free to use by anyone to use without restrictions – have introduced new processes for how local and municipal governments manage government owned data. To the credit of many policymakers, the principles of Open Data have been enthusiastically embraced in legislation[2]  and government practices. The benefits of Open Data are well documented,[3] but governments adopting Open Data initiatives also have the risk of exposing personally identifiable information. This risk has led to concerns that if not adequately addressed, will block the adoption of Open Data policies.  

Municipal governments in particular are at the tip of the spear in facing this challenge. Local and city governments interface with citizens on a daily basis, collecting and providing substantial amounts of data. Thus it is no surprise that advocates of Open Data have sought to push municipal government to make government owned data public available. Government entities, however, often lack the resources to adequately address the potential privacy issues involved. 

For example, the City of Oakland has been a municipal leader in adopting Open Data initiatives —initiatives that have led to more transparent and accessible data generated in the operation of government business or collected about individual citizens as a part of city services.[4] These initiatives, however, introduced new and unique challenges around individual privacy. And at times, citizens have reacted strongly against government efforts to leverage data, either for internal use[5] or even more seemingly innocuous efforts to make government activities more transparent.[6]   

These reactions led the City of Oakland to take a leadership role to deliberately evaluate Open Data initiatives. Working in collaboration, the City Attorney of Oakland and Startup Policy Lab hosted an invite only Roundtable to address the challenges and issues posed by government managed data. The Roundtable gathered together leaders in government at the local, state, and international level to discuss the challenges local government faces in light of Open Data initiatives. 

The purpose of the Roundtable was to introduce local policymakers to the unique challenges Open Data poses to government agencies in order to (i) identify critical areas required for policy development; (ii) share knowledge between subject-matter experts to further our understanding of the issues; and, (iii) identify further areas for research. At the conclusion of the Roundtable, Startup Policy Lab drafted this Report with a series of recommendations for policymakers to develop implementable solutions.
 
**A.	Objectives & Deliverables**

In light of the early stage of this process, the Roundtable’s core objective was purposefully limited: initiate a conversation and develop a foundation for future meetings. In addition, the framework for the discussion was substantially informed by actual challenges the City of Oakland has experienced at the intersection of public data and government services. Within this context, the Roundtable sought to identify the necessary steps to lay a foundation for the provision of resources, skills, and tools for other cities in similar circumstances. 

More directly, the Roundtable set forth three objectives.  

-	Host a second roundtable to inform municipal policymakers and elected officials of the unique challenges posed by Open Data initiatives, and use that roundtable as a model for future discussions;

-	Use the roundtable to identify challenges posed by existing practices and policies, with the goal of determining what’s working and what isn’t; and,

-	Publish recommendations on practical next steps that can be taken by the participants in order to continue the momentum of the first roundtable.

**B.	Roundtable Presentations**

1/ *Kiran Jain, Senior Deputy, City Attorney of Oakland*

Kiran Jain’s presentation provided an overview of the City of Oakland’s Open Data initiatives. Three topics were outlined for the participants. The first was Oakland’s Open Data laws, specifically Resolution No. 84659. Second, Jain discussed Oakland’s online technology, including the Open Data Portal. The Open Data Portal provides a range of data, including information about local crime reports and even information about the city’s art collection. And third, Jain reviewed challenges faced by the City of Oakland; namely, real world experiences the City of Oakland dealt with because of their RecordTrac and Shotspotter programs, and some of the challenges encountered in the launch of Oakland’s Domain Awareness Center.

2/ *Joy Bonaguro, Chief Data Officer of San Francisco*

The Chief Data Officer of San Francisco, Joy Bonaguro is tasked with designing and implementing the City’s data policy. This process began in early in 2014 and the first phase of implementation was introduced in Fall 2014. Bonaguro presented on the difficulties in balancing privacy, transparency, and Open Data. Building on this framework, Bonaguro reviewed the technical aspects of the proposed architecture that the City will implement through data inventory and raw classification. Processes and control points were introduced as concepts under the umbrella data stewardship, including defining formal methods or standards that are consistent with technical implementation. The presentation highlighted the Chief Data Officer’s efforts to: (i) develop standard methods and processes; (ii) deploy privacy algorithms; (iii) and navigate sometimes conflicting privacy laws at the local, state, and federal level that can complicate Open Data efforts. 

3/	*Emily Shaw, National Policy Manager, Sunlight Foundation*

Emily Shaw is the National Policy Manager for the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for open government globally and harnesses technology to make government more accountable to all. Shaw’s presentation focused on the role of the Sunlight Foundation in helping to contribute to the development of state and municipal Open Data policies nationally, and focusing especially on the intersection of Open Data polices with personally identifiable information. Critical takeaways include the ability of government data-holders to achieve the benefits of Open Data through individual data-sharing agreements; the possibility of government data-holders to externalize potential liability, thereby making it easier to share; and the development of better technical tools for government actors to protect individual privacy. 

**C.	Identified Issues **

The pervasive nature of government means that the challenges posed by Open Data initiatives to individual privacy touch upon just about every aspect of an individual's life. Local and municipal governments engage with personal data across a range of areas, such as geo-location, planning permits, energy usage, and more. The opportunities and challenges for government to make data accessible are staggering. But as stewards of data, municipalities require thoughtful and deliberative policies to balance the need to make government data accessible with individual privacy concerns.

Beginning with the concept of a data steward, the participants framed the discussion around addressing a critical question: **what does it mean for a government to be a good data steward?** For the purposes of the Roundtable, the role of data stewardship meant understanding the government as the pivot around which a number of data concerns revolve. This included appreciating the government’s responsibility for thinking about the care of the storage of that data and using that data in beneficial ways.

With that context in mind, the Roundtable touched upon a wide range of issues at the intersection of Open Data initiatives and privacy. Unfortunately, the depth and complexity of those issues prevented every issue from being comprehensively addressed in the limited time available. Nonetheless, five critical issues emerged that participants felt deserved prioritization and additional study for future Roundtables. (See Addendum for a more detailed look at these five critical issues).

**FOIA vs. Open Data Frameworks:** Traditional legal frameworks for data management originate with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) legal regime. But the Open Data movement is more expansive and includes new data-driven processes.[7] The differences between these two frameworks, while subtle, have led to conflicts when implementing practices because of confusion, uncertainty, and inconsistent policies. 

**Data Classification:** Efforts to publish data, while still protecting personally identifiable information, have led to attempts at classifying data at different levels of sensitivity. This approach, however, can be problematic. Tools and techniques for re-identification and de-anonymization are becoming increasingly sophisticated. 

**Policy Expertise:** Governments must establish the internal expertise to set policies and develop resources. This expertise includes subject matter experts and bureaucratic bodies with the authority to make decisions and implement practices. Unfortunately, this requires additional resources many governments do not have.

**Non-consensual transparency:** Unlike private industry, government entities often compel the collection of personally identifiable information; citizens have no choice on whether or not to disclose their personal information. This introduces unique challenges and distinguishes government practices from private industry.

**Potential liability:** Like data brokers, governments are collecting information for a variety of purposes. And while liability concerns are not a new concept, Open Data policies introduce new depth, range, and variations on traditional liability as governments continue to adopt the role of data brokers.
