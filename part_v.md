An overview of some of the types of information it is possible to gather about urban environments through strategically-placed sensors, and how that might change the way cities operate.2. *The Social Laboratory* (http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/29/the_social_laboratory_singapore_surveillance_state). Municipal data gathering taken to the extreme in Singapore, where nearly every aspect of citizens' lives is collected, collated, and calculated, all in the service of "maintaining national order."3. *For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights* (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html). There is a significant gap between theory and practice in big data, and merely having data is a long way from being able to put it to effective use.4. *Think Again—Big Data: Why the rise of machines isn't all it's cracked up to be* (http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/05/09/think_again_big_data).

This article provides a general overview of how big data can be technically correct but still give us wrong answers.5. *Civil Rights, Big Data, and Our Algorithmic Future* (http://bigdata.fairness.io).

Security Concerns Raised over San Diego-based App Trapster (http://www.10news.com/news/investigations/security-concerns-raised-over-san-diego-based-app-trapster-020714): Nokia’s Trapster app tracks accidents and hazards on the road, but also incidentally allows users to track each other in real-time.  This raises concerns over the amount of disclosure that Nokia has or hasn’t provided, and how law enforcement can potentially use this data.
